# Java Currency Conversion Project

## Introduction

This is the first personal project done using Java. The aim of this project is to create a currency conversion application with a GUI that can accept an amount from the user and convert it to the corresponding currency chosen by the user. Currently there are only 3 currencies included in the application (USD, EUR & GBP). Moreover, all these exchange rates are hard coded into the application.

## Possible improvements

1. Instead of  hard coding the exchange rates, perhaps using an API that provides near real-time updates on exchange rates could be used.
2. Adding more currencies into the system.
3. Allow the user to choose the base currency. Currently, the main currency is fixed to MYR (my local currency).
